<h1 align=center>How it harms and its Operations and functions

<h2>Parts</h2>
<p>A viable computer virus must contain a search routine, which locates new files or new disks which are worthwhile targets for infection. 
Secondly, every computer virus must contain a routine to copy itself into the program which the search routine locates.<html> The three main virus parts are:
</P>

<h3>Infection mechanism</h3>
<p>Infection mechanism (also called 'infection vector'), is how the virus spreads or propagates. A virus typically has a search routine, 
which locates new files or new disks for infection.
</p>
<h3>Trigger</h3>
<p>The trigger, which is also known as a logic bomb, is the compiled version that could be activated any time within an executable file when the virus
is run that determines the event or condition for the malicious "payload" to be activated or delivered such as a particular date, a particular time, 
particular presence of another program, capacity of the disk exceeding some limit,[44] or a double-click that opens a particular file.
</p>
<h3>Payload
</h3><p>The "payload" is the actual body or data which carries out the malicious purpose of the virus. Payload activity might be noticeable (e.g., because it causes
 the system to slow down or "freeze"), as most of the time the "payload" itself is the harmful activity, or some times non-destructive but distributive, 
which is called virus hoax.
</p>
<h3>Phases
</h3><p>Virus phases is the life cycle of the computer virus, described by using an analogy to biology. This life cycle can be divided into four phases:
</p>
<h3>Dormant phase</h3>
<p>The virus program is idle during this stage. The virus program has managed to access the target user's computer or software, but during this stage, 
the virus does not take any action. The virus will eventually be activated by the "trigger" which states which event will execute the virus. Not all 
viruses have this stage.
</p>
<h3>Propagation phase</h3>
<p>The virus starts propagating, that is multiplying and replicating itself. The virus places a copy of itself into other programs or into certain system
 areas on the disk. The copy may not be identical to the propagating version; viruses often "morph" or change to evade detection by IT professionals 
and anti-virus software.
 Each infected program will now contain a clone of the virus, which will itself enter a propagation phase.
</p>
<h3>Triggering phase</h3>
<p>A dormant virus moves into this phase when it is activated, and will now perform the function for which it was intended. The triggering phase can be
caused by a variety of system events, including a count of the number of times that this copy of the virus has made copies of itself.[42] The trigger
 may occur when an employee is terminated from their employment or after a set period of time has elapsed, in order to reduce suspicion.
</p>
<h3>Execution phase</h3>
<p>This is the actual work of the virus, where the "payload" will be released. It can be destructive such as deleting files on disk, crashing the system, or 
corrupting files or relatively harmless such as popping up humorous or political messages on screen.
